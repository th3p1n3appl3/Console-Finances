# Console-Finances

## Description

In this project, I managed to get the opportunity to practice some JavaScript code again to do a simple financial analysis. I originally attempted this challenge even before classes started to see how much I could remember and how well I would fare.

I am aware that my approach to split the array is less elegant than what we were taught in class and my original intention was to refactor my code but I ultimately ran out of time.

I have also used this as an opportunity to get comfortable with functions again as I have covered them in previous coding endeavours.

Here is the link to the deployed application: https://th3p1n3appl3.github.io/Console-Finances/
